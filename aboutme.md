# My story
**I started as a IT guy**
<p>My story begins at Elementary school where I had to choose a field of my future studies. 
I applied for a IT school because I was always enthusiastic about technology and computers.</p> <p>After few years I realised that IT is not for me and that I wanted to do something more creative. I have been lucky that in our school arose a media house where I started shooting and editing video reports from various events. </p>
<p>As I was getting more into videomaking my close friend started producing music and I started to shoot and edit his music videos, visuals, photos etc... This woke my passion in photography and video, That’s why after graduating I decided to switch fields a little bit and I went to VŠKK where I currently study Photography and visual arts.</p>

# My Interests
<p>As I said my interests is Photo and Video. I really enjoy writing/directing work as well as shooting and editing. Sometimes I do graphic work like logos, posters or menus for bars and restaurants. </p>
<p>Also, thanks to our school, I am a little bit into marketing/advertising.</p>
<p>Other than that, I enjoy a lot of sports. For 9 years I played floorball as a goalkeeper at AC Sparta Praha (till 2015), then I ended my “career” and for some time I was playing basketball. Now I am not in any professional team, but I am playing for HC Kapři Říčany which is a hobby beer league ice hockey team. </p>

<p>My other passion is winter sports. I am skiing since i was 2 years old and now during holidays I work as a Ski and SNB instructor at Vítkovice.</p>
<p>
 Naturally my other likes are music and films, sometimes videogames when i have time for that. 
 My favorite films are from Edgar Wright (i just love well writen and edited visual comedy) especially the Cornetto trilogy and films by Quentin Tarantino.
 My go to music genres are: DnB, Rap, and some experimental masterpieces. Sometimes i also try to DJ in my bedroom just for fun and actually i played 2 gigs as a DJ for my friends Show (that one friend who got me into videomaking), but i do not consider it as my career path (yet?).
