# My story
**I started as a IT guy**
<p>My story begins at Elementary school where I had to choose a field of my future studies. 
I applied for a IT school because I was always enthusiastic about technology and computers.</p> <p>After few years I realised that IT is not for me and that I wanted to do something more creative. I have been lucky that in our school arose a media house where I started shooting and editing video reports from various events. </p>
<p>As I was getting more into videomaking my close friend started producing music and I started to shoot and edit his music, visuals, photos etc... This woke my passion in photography and video, Thatâ€™s why after school I decided to switch fields a little bit and I went to VSKK where I currently study Photography and visual arts.</p>
