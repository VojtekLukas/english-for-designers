<H1>One Word</H1>

##DEADLINE 
<p>
  Deadline. The word that can ruin my day, week even month. When everything goes well you have fun at school enjoying life teacher or boss is describing some interesting tasks and then it comes. 
  That word. DEADLINE. Why does this word even exist? Whose idea was to connect the words “Dead” and “Line”. Are we in some stupid B grade horror? Well, tell me who invented it, and I am gonna put him there.
</p>
<p>
  When I hear this word, I imagine a finish line and when you cross it well… you die. Exactly what would happen in that stupid movie. 
  Like are there anything good after the line? Are there some scary monsters in a form of more deadlines?
</p>
<p>
  Its fascinating how one little word can cause so much stress. It’s like a magic word to summon anxiety.  Like “hey, could you do this or that” “Thanks, and by the way... DEADLINE is …” and then I stopped listening because that’s all I don’t wanted to hear.

  Maybe we could change this curse word to something less frightening. For example, “doneness line” or maybe “happiness line” so that you could be more motivated and excited.
  “Hey, your happiness term is coming next Monday” sounds much more better than “next Monday you will die”. 
</p>
<p>
  But maybe the word exists to keep us on the right path. To keep us concentrated because otherwise we would lose ourselves in sea of rainbows and happy unicorns and corporate word is not like that. 
  Maybe the word deadline helps us to deal with stress better an encourages us to literally overcome death.

  Maybe we could find something in the middle, but I must go because well … bachelor thesis DEADLINE is coming.
