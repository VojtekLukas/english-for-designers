<H1>VOICE TONE STYLE</H1>

## VOICE
### Direct
<p>
  I always try to be as clear as possible so that both sides understand what I mean and what we are talking about. 
  I like direct conversation without uselessness’s an empty phrases.
</p>

### Adequate 
<p>
  I understand that different occasions need different approach. In formal situations I try to be as polite as I can and in friendly conversations, I use informal more relieved voice.
</p>

### Trustful
<p>
  I always want to be trusted so I speak clearly and authentically “without dials” so that the counterpart can be sure that they have serious partner in me. 
</p>

## TONE
### Friendly
<p>
  All the time I want to be friendly and emphatic. I don’t want to sound do serious or aloof. 
  I just want to approach people with good altitude because I expect them the same.
</p>

### Calm
<p>
  My tone is most of the time calm. I don’t really enjoy heated conversations because I think that everything needs to be resolved with a little overview.
  Even when someone approaches me angrily, I try to be as calm as possible to solve the situation.
</p>

## STYLE
### Informal
<p>
Most of the time I speak and write informal. I just think that that’s the natural way for me to communicate. But on the other hand, I do realise that different situations need different approaches. 
  So, when the time comes, I can switch to formal language easily.
</p>

### Authentic
<p>
  I really hate hypocrisy so I am always as authentic as I can. I think that this is the only way to create true partnerships, without any dissimulations.
