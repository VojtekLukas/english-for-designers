**Travis Mayers Bysnysman (music video)**

This was my most complex shoot. We wanted to create a film-like video clip other than generic rap videos. The writing and shooting took about 2-3 weeks and during this project i started to think a little different about my style and it set light on direction that i would like to go. That is creating music videos with coherent stories. 



**Café-Bar Baribal (logo, menu, photos)**

In 2022 i did complete visual of Café-Bar Baribal based in Jičín, i shoot promo pictures of foods and drinks, designed the logo and created the menu and wie list.
Shortly after we shoot a short commercial for IG and few reels. This was my first real cotract as a photographer and designer.
