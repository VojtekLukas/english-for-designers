<h1>Year in Review</h1>
<p>
Wow .. this year was just ... wow. I donâ€™t really know where to start. Well maybe at the beginning.
At the start of this academic year, I went through series of illnesses. First, I was recovering from broken ancle and then Iâ€™ve got tonsillitis which is my signature illness. I suffer from it quite a lot and standard antibiotics doesnâ€™t work for me. But well, no time to make excuses. Iâ€™ve tried my best to catch up. Although we had less courses than last year there was a lot of projects to do and things to learn. Especially philosophy this year was hard. Together with that there were other challenges like finding contracts, pimping up portfolio etc. 

</p>

<H2>What i learned</H2>
<p>
  This year I learned a lot. First, I would think beforehand that I will have to dust off my web coding knowledge from high school thanks to github xD. Well maybe I will get back to it in future.</p>
  <p>
  Related to our English for Designers course Iâ€™ve learned to speak better. Or at least Iâ€™ve got more certitude and courage in public speaking. Which I am thankful for. Iâ€™ve even started to think in English when I need to speak so I can easily switch in different language which I find really helpful.
</p>
<p>
  Then I learned a lot about myself. I started dealing with stress better and overall, I started feeling better about myself and my future. 
</p>
<H2>Improving Further</H2>
<p>
  To the future improvements. I look up to getting better in English especially in professional language and specific terms in my field. 
</p>
<p>
  Then I would like to explore more of myself and search for good place in creative industry that I will like. 
</p>
<H2>The End</H2>
<p>
  After all the obstacles it was a great year. You always have to end optimistic xD. Ive learned a lot a I really enjoyed the time spent in school. Even at the boring lectures (NOT THIS ONE) thereâ€™s always something good. Iâ€™ve had spent a lot of time with my new friends with I really appreciate, because, in my eyes, friendship and love are the best things in life to enjoy.
</p>
<p>
  So, thank you all for this amazing year and iam looking forward to new challenges, new opportunities, and new experiences, because there are always many things to enjoy.
</p>
<p>
See you next year ðŸ˜Š </p>
