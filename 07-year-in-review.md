<h1>Year in Review</h1>
<p>
Wow .. this year was just ... wow. I don’t really know where to start. Well maybe at the beginning.
At the start of this academic year, I went through series of illnesses. First, I was recovering from broken ancle and then I’ve got tonsillitis which is my signature illness. I suffer from it quite a lot and standard antibiotics doesn’t work for me. But well, no time to make excuses. I’ve tried my best to catch up. Although we had less courses than last year there was a lot of projects to do and things to learn. Especially philosophy this year was hard. Together with that there were other challenges like finding contracts, pimping up portfolio etc.

  This year I learned a lot. First, I would think beforehand that I will have to dust off my web coding knowledge from high school thanks to github xD. Well maybe I will get back to it in future.
